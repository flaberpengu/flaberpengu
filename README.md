## flaberpengu

Hello! I’m flaberpengu, a university student currently studying computer science and some mathematics, as well as occassionally creating (debatably) cool stuff in my free time.

On my Github, you'll find any projects I make in my spare time, any programming exercises I do (think [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), etc.), and other stuff like CTF scripts I make.

### Languages and tools

What I develop in is usually dependent on the requirements of whatever I'm working on, though I prefer to use the following languages and tools where possible:

### Where else can you find me?
I host my own blog which you can find [here](https://flaberpengu.me/). I tend to post about my projects, any other topics I consider interesting enough to share my views on, and CTF writeups from past CTFs I have competed in.
