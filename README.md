## flaberpengu

Hello! I’m flaberpengu, a university student currently studying computer science and some mathematics, as well as occassionally creating (debatably) cool stuff in my free time.

On my Github, you'll find any projects I make in my spare time, any programming exercises I do (think [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), etc.), and other stuff like CTF scripts I make.

I primarily develop in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/" target="_blank"> <img alt="Rust" width="15px" src="https://rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-128x128-blk-v2.png" style="background-color: white; vertical-align: middle;"/> </a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"> <img alt="Rust" width="15px" src="https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/community/logos/python-logo-only.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> </a>
depending on the requirements of whatever I'm working on. However, you may find older repos where I have used other languages, often just for fun.

### Where else can you find me?
I host my own blog which you can find [here](https://flaberpengu.me/). I tend to post about my projects, any other topics I consider interesting enough to share my views on, and CTF writeups from past CTFs I have competed in.
